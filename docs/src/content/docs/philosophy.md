description: The philosphy of numz
---

Numz adopts the [**Extended array programming paradigm**](), as it is built on top of the [**ZikoJS Math module**]().

It is inspired by:
- **NumPy**
- **SciPy**
- **MATLAB**

Numz guarantees a **layered, shape-safe, function-first numerical computing model**, designed to scale naturally from scalars to tensors while preserving mathematical correctness and clarity.

<!-- Numz is a layered, shape-safe, function-first numerical computing library that brings true array programming and scientific mathematics to JavaScript, built on the top of [Zikojs](). -->
